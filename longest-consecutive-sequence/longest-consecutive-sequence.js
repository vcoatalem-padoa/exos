/**
 * @method longestConsecutiveSequence
 * @param arr: an array of relative integers. e.g: [1, 5, -2, -1]
 * @returns the length of the longest sequence of sequential number that can be formed using numbers from the provided array, or array.length if array.length <= 1
 * 
 * ex: 
 * 
 * longestConsecutiveSequence([1, 2, 3]) === 3
 * longestConsecutiveSequence([2, 4, 1]) === 2
 * longestConsecutiveSequence([-42, 0, 10, 1, -1]) === 2
