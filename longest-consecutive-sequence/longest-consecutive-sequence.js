/**
 * @method longestConsecutiveSequence
 * 
 * @param array: an array of relative integers. e.g: [1, 5, -2, -1]
 * 
 * @returns the length of the longest sequence of sequential number that can be formed using numbers from the provided array
 * 
 * @description a sequence of sequential numbers is a sequence of numbers that can be ordered in a way that each number is followed by the next number in the sequence. We consider a sequence of 1 number to be valid.
 * 
 *
 * @example longestConsecutiveSequence([1, 2, 3]) === 3
 * @example longestConsecutiveSequence([2, 4, 1]) === 2
 * @example longestConsecutiveSequence([-42, 0, 10, 1, -1]) === 2
